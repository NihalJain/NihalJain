As a seasoned Software Engineer, I specialize in Big Data, Hadoop, Cloud, Master Data Management, and NoSQL Databases. I've dedicated years to developing distributed systems and scalable services using Java, Scala, and Python. I also contribute to open-source communities, notably Apache HBase. My teaching experience comes from the National Institute of Technology, Meghalaya, and I hold degrees from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, and Assam Engineering College. With a deep passion for computer science, I've been engaging in coding for over 12 years and am an ever-curious learner.
